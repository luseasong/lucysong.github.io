					<div id="sub-head">Background</div>

					<div>
					Banking apps are super useful and convenient for customers. Common features include easy access to statements and depositing checks without having to wait in a line.	However, a problem arises when such features are difficult to find within the app and go unnoticed.
					</div>

					<div id="sub-head">Problem Statement</div>

					<div>
					Bank of America’s mobile banking app has many hidden features that customers could find useful, but have difficulty actually finding due to its design.
 
					</div>

					</div>
					<div>
					This was one of my weekly sprints that Innovative Design challenged me to do during Fall 2019. Given the short turnaround, I was unable to conduct proper user research, so I turned to the app’s reviews on the App Store.

					<div id="sub-head">Unoptimized Organization</div>

					<div>Many users felt that the app had great features such as Bill Pay and raved about how they could do pretty much everything on the app, IF they looked hard enough for it. The reality is though, not every user spends the time to read everything and explore every feature. Some commented that the UI makes each feature look like a distraction.</div>

					<div id="sub-head">Aesthetics and Feel</div>

					<div>Users noted that the app’s UI felt basic and directionless but exceptional customer service over the phone could make up for it.  A major part of this redesign was to make sure each design decision was intentional. Customers should not need to call support in order to use the app.</div>

					<div id="sub-head">Design Goals</div>

					<div>
					<b>Streamline</b> — Increase ease of access and clarity of currently hidden features
					<br>
					<b>Centralize</b> — Concentrate pertinent interactions and information into a singular dashboard.
					<br>
					<b>Update</b> — Bring app aesthetics up to speed with current visual trends and patterns.
					</div>

					<div id="sub-head">Design Decisions</div>
					<div><p><b>Accounts</b> — For those with multiple checkings and savings accounts, it could get confusing which is which going just by account numbers, so I wanted to create additional visuals. A representation of an account in real life is the credit/debit card tied to it. Customers are more likely to recognize which account is which by seeing the card they use to pay in real life. I put 3 important pieces of information on the page: balance, recent transactions, and a button that would direct the user to a page with more data visualizations that would help a customer understand how they are spending their money.
					</p>

					<p><b>Transactions</b> — A transaction history is useful information when one cannot remember how much an item was for example, or to potentially catch fraudulent charges. However, transactions can get buried, Adding an ability to search for a specific transaction remedies that.</p>
					<p><b>Dashboard</b> — The original dashboard was a bit more hidden. Having smaller icons and more icons per row will provide a broader overview of the app. In addition, the hamburger menu opens up to a list view of the dashboard so that each feature is represented.</p>

						As a user of the app itself, this sprint provided an opportunity to go through all the features myself and I was actually surprised by the sheer amount of things the app could do. Something I would love to see would be a better feature for budgeting (but that’s a project for another day). A realization I had while reading the reviews was that the app’s easy access to support quickly calmed customers who lost their card or had their account breached. Bank of America is big on customer service and it was interesting to see how that carried over into their app. I enjoyed this sprint but if I had more time, I would do more iterations after user testing.
