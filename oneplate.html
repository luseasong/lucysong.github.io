					<div>
					Every year, over a hundred billion pounds of food waste is generated by people across the country. Not only does this mean that nourishment necessary for our survival is going unused, but so has the resources gone into producing it. In addition, food waste has detrimental effects of the environment. Humans throw away food, entering landfills. The unwanted foods in landfills do not decompose properly and release a dangerous greenhouse gas, methane. Because of the large amounts of methane entering the atmosphere into the ozone layer, climate changes occur, causing climate change that can negatively impact the environment. Food entering landfills release methane, harming the environment and humans.

					We conducted 15+ interviews with CalDining workers, college freshmen, college upperclassmen, and adults about their eating and grocery habits to pin point jobs, pains, and gains. We used this information to produce the following persona, journey map, and insights.

					</div>

					<div id="sub-head">Key Insights</div>

					<div>
					1. People want more control of portion sizes.
					</div>

					<div>
					2. Leftover food results from getting portion sizes too large, especially in dining halls where people can't even take out leftover food.
					</div>

					<div>
					3. People don't always know how big of a portion they should be eating.
					</div>

					<div id="sub-head">Goals</div>

					<div>
					Our goals were to design a product that would allow people to control their portion sizes to promote healthier eating and less food waste. We were focusing on the dining hall setting, but wanted to make sure that these plates would also be useful in households. So, <div id="sub-head">How might we help customers customize and control their portion sizes to prevent food waste?</div>

					</div>

					<div id="sub-head">The Concept</div>
						<div> After a few rounds of ideation, we decided on a plate that could shrink or expand to adjust it's size to improve portion control. </div>

					<div id="sub-head">First Prototype</div>

					<div id="prototype">
						<img src="assets/img/oneplate-first.png">
					</div>

					<div>
						For our first prototype, we laser cut out pieces from wood to assemble into what we invisioned: a plate which controllable surface area and dividers. We used this protoype to conduct usability tests by asking people to change the size of the plate themselves and serve themselves plastic/fake food. From our first usability tests, feedback included comments such as that the material was off-putting since most people, especially dining halls, don't use wooden plates and that our plates would be difficult to stack together.
					</div>

					<div id="sub-head">Second Iteration</div>

					<div>
						We were limited with what materials we could prototype with because we were using our school's makerspace, but given what was learned from our first test, we switched to acrylic. We also made the dividers removeable for easier washing and so that plates could be stacked. We intended for the divider to be like another utesil, like another spoon or fork, that you grab before the plate so you can toggle it in line and then hand to the dining hall worker or before you serve yourself at home. 
					</div>

					<div id="sub-head">Second Prototype</div>

					<div id="prototype">
						<img src="assets/img/oneplate-second.png">
						<img src="assets/img/oneplate-second2.png">
					</div>

					<div>
						From our second round of usability tests, people appreciated the fact that the prototype was not wood, but felt that there were too many moving places and were concerned with how sanitary it would be to reuse the plate. People thought that food that got stuck between the moving parts would be difficult to clean. Our professor also brought up the concern that our plate did not have a rim.
					</div>

					<div id="sub-head">Final Prototype</div>

					<div id="prototype">
						<img src="assets/img/oneplate-final-flat.png">
						<img src="assets/img/oneplate-final.png">
					</div>

					<div>
						For our final iteration and prototype, we redesigned OnePlate in order to not have moving parts but still have a toggleable functionality. Our final design is simply a sheet of plastic that was scored so it could be folded into different sizes and held together by snap closures. We focused on being able to change the surface area of the bottom of the plate.

					<div id="sub-head">Closing Thoughts</div>

					<div>
						I would have liked to have been given the opportunity to test my prototype in an actual dining hall to see if my changes were effective and what else could be improved. Also given the opportunity, I would have liked to test different types of plastics, and try to find an environmentally friendly but still sturdy option.
