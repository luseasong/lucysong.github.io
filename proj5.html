					<div>
					Every Fall semester, Innovative Design holds its Come Make Your marK (CMYK) Designathon. For Fall 2018, the sponsor was Course Hero and the prompt my team chose to follow was to create an event that Course Hero could host on campus around midterms season or finals week. We came up with an event called "Destress for Success: an event for recharging."

					<div id="sub-head"></div>

					<div>
					We wanted to create an event for students to chill and recharge in the midst of finals season, as well as get study help from Course Hero. Our idea involved a pop-up "shop" with different areas for different ways to destress.

					<div> We considered different ways our peers destressed, which included memes, talking their problems out, meditation, and getting academic help. So, we created areas for each of these methods, keeping CourseHero and what they could offer in mind. There are 4 "corners."
					</div>

					<ul>
						<li>The CourseHero Corner, where students can seek tutoring to ease academic worries.</li>
						<li>The Meme Corner, where students can seek comic relief.</li>
						<li>The Rant Corner, where students can talk out their stresses.</li>
						<li>The Zen Corner, where students can relax.</li>
					</ul>

					<div>Destress For Success ended up winning Most Creative Solution at CMYK. I had a lot of fun working with my team, who I met the day of at CMYK, so it was a great experience working with new peers and bringing all our ideas and skills together.</div>
