					<div>
					At the start of every semester, Berkeley Innovation, a design consultancy club, releases a Design Challenge as part of their recruitment process. For Fall 2019, the prompt was:
					<p>
					​​"Imagine the experience of a student navigating through campus*. Please identify a particular problem that they may have during their journey, and design a solution for how you would improve this experience."
					</p>
					I had to:
					<br>
					1) Narrow down the scope and identify what problem you want to focus on.
					<br>
					2) Use the human-centered design process to come up with a potential solution to the problem.

					<div id="sub-head"></div>

					<div>
					I conducted 5 contextual interviews to gain perspective on what problems college students have when navigating campus.

					<div>
					<p>Questions asked included:</p>
					"What problems have you experienced?"<br>
					"Do you already had a solution for it, and if so, what is it?"<br>
					<p>
					The first interviewee, a freshman, said she had no idea where the restrooms were in buildings she has never gone to the restroom in before. I incorporated in-depth restroom questions from that interview in the ones after. Difficult-to-find restrooms turned out to be a trend! Other common answers: unable to find destination, getting lost, and time inefficiency. </p>

					</div>

					<ol> 
						<li><b>[Need]</b> People can use apps like Google Maps to find a <b>building</b> they’ve never been in before, but it is much harder to find a <b>classroom, auditorium or restroom</b>, especially if there is no nearby sign for directions. </li>
						<li><b>[Pain Point]</b> During the 10 minutes between classes. For example, “I get really stressed when I can’t find the building my lecture hall is in, let alone where my discussion is, during those 10 minutes. I feel like it makes me worse at finding it too because I'm under unnecessary pressure.” </li>
						<li><b>[Behavior]</b> People develop favorite bathrooms that they will go out of the way for it one of their favorite bathrooms is the closest one they know of. </li>
							<p>“Good” Bathroom Qualities: full-length mirrors, clean, lots of stalls, privacy, uncrowded, relatively new<br>
							“Bad” Bathroom Qualities: unclean/old, cramped, long lines</p>
					</ol>

						<div id="section-name">TAKEAWAYS</div>
					</div>

					<ul> 
						<li><b>[Unmet Need]</b> College campuses are huge, which not only makes them difficult to navigate, but also, intimidating. </li>
						<li><b>[Pain Point]</b> The large size of a campus can mean an overwhelming number of buildings, greater distances to traverse, or both which increases travel time. </li>
						<li><b>[Pain Point]</b> Time is of the essence! These factors all contribute to making finding a buildings and room on campus hard, especially restrooms, for college students. For bathrooms specifically, when you gotta go, you gotta go, and that adds another bit of pressure when navigating campus.</li>
					</ul>

						I would have liked to have interviewed more people to get a better sample size and gain more insight into the issue. In addition to, it would be amazing to be able to make a functioning mobile app out of this.
