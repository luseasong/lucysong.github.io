					<div>
					The Breakfast Buddy is an all-in-one toaster I came up with for a class, DES INV 21: Visual Communication and Sketching. It is a toaster with a built-in alarm clock and kettle for all your morning needs.

					<div>
					The prompt for this quick sketch was to draw a product we would like to see on the market.

					<div id="sub-head">One-Pager</div>

					<div id="research">

					</div>

					<div>
					This was the one-pager I created to communicate my idea. We learned skills such as drawing in perspective and how to organize information hierarchies to produce quality one-pagers.

					<div>
					One assignment was to create a slide deck as if we were trying to pitch our product. Prior to the assignment, I was taught basic rules for creating decks that I tried to implement in my own.

					<div>
						I also had to create a video to communicate my idea. This built upon editing skills I already had, but I enjoyed editing a video that was more of an advertisement style and playing with animation.
