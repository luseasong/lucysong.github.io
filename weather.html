					<div>
					I start off every morning with a cup of tea and checking the weather. I like to be informed when I put together outfits, plan my day, and just in general. For years, I've been using The Weather Channel's app so when they redesigned the interface in 2018, I was seriously disappointed, and so were many other users.

					<div>
					I did my own analysis of my own user journery and gathered data from the App Store reviews to pin point main problem areas.

					<div>
					Many people believed the app was too bright and hard to read. Another common complaint was that the information was not displayed in a helpful manner and things were either impossible to find or redundant and did not add to the experience of using the app.

					<div>
					1. Users want concise and clear weather information.
					</div>

					<div>
					2. Many individuals for the bright, white interface difficult to read.
					</div>

					<div>
					3. Users want relevant weather data.
					</div>

					<div id="sub-head">Goals</div>

					<div>
					My goal was to redesign the interface and reorganize the information hierarchy such to better meet the needs of the user.

					</div>

					<div>
						Though I kept the original color scheme, which went well with their logo's colors, I tried to the interface easier on the eyes by using different font weights and colorful icons to direct attention. The first page you see when you open the app tells you the current temperature and weather conditions, but the rest of the page gives a concise overview of the rest of the day, complete with the highest/lowest temperatures as well as wind and weather conditions. If the user wants a more in-depth, hour-by-hour weather report, the Hourly view is easily accessible. Similarly with the weekly view. I also changed the anchor/menu on the bottom to provide clear and direct access the other features of the app such as the news and videos.

					<div>
						I would have liked to have been given the opportunity to test my prototype and see if my changes were effective and what else could be improved. Unfortunately, I could not gather enough of my peers to do so.
